This is a custom repo for installing digipres tools not in Caskroom/homebrew-cask or for just messing around

To install any of these formulae, first run `brew tap EG-tech/digipres`

# Available formulae

## Casks

- [vrecord-gui](https://github.com/EG-tech/vrecord-gui)

Installs a custom MacOS applet that launches [vrecord](https://github.com/amiaopensource/vrecord) in GUI mode (i.e., executes `vrecord -g`). As opposed to an executable shell script, applet can be added to MacOS LaunchPad or Dock, making vrecord as accessible as any GUI application. vrecord must previously be installed.
